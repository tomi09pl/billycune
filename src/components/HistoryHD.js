                        The water-cooled Revolution engine does not
                        have much in common with a classic Harley-Davidson engine,
                        except for the long-stroke design and 45 degree cylinder windlass.
                        The engine performed from 1130ccm with 117 to 1250ccm at 124 hp.
                        The engine from 2001 was developed in cooperation with Porsche
                        on the basis of the VR1000 racing engine.

                        The Twin Cam engine delivered more torque and power than the Evolution
                        model and was originally available as a carburetor or with fuel injection.
                        Problems with oil circulation in the Evolution engine prompted Harley-Davidson
                        to equip the Twin Cam with a more powerful internal twin engine oil pump.
                        Meanwhile, the engine reaches up to 1801ccm³ and up to 97 hp.

                    <p>This text need to be changed for SEO purposes!
                        This engine is the basis of all models in the Sportster family,
                        and almost all Buell models are also powered by performance-enhanced,
                        model-maintained derivatives of the Evolution Sportster engine.
                        The engine ranges from 883cm³ with 46 HP to 1202cm³ with 67 HP.
                        In 2007, the Keihin CV carburettor was replaced by an electronic intake
                        manifold injection system. The Sportster models are considered to be
                        the most inexpensive former Harley-Davidson models.

                        The 1340ccm³ Evolution engine lived up to its name because it was a true evolution.
                        The “Evo” needs significantly less fuel and generates significantly more torque
                        at the same time. On top, it turns more quietly and is therefore also more durable.
                        It was the engine for the then brand-new Softail, which today is regarded
                        as the forefather of the complete Softail series. Depending on the version,
                        it achieves up to 65 hp.

                        Once again, the look of the rocker boxes gives this Harley engine its name.
                        The cylinder head cover reminds of shovels, hence Shovelhead.
                        The 1340 cm³ 65 hp engine has new cylinder heads with redesigned ducts and compact
                        combustion chambers, higher compression pistons, new camshaft and a new carburettor.
                        The last Harley-Davidson engine not developed with computer aided design.

                        The then new small, modern engine with a sporty character is driven by a spur gear camshaft.
                        The version with cast iron cylinder and cylinder heads still had 883cm³,
                        this is why it is called Ironhead. The engine was used to drive the then new Sportster
                        series. It was the first Harley that had a whole horsepower per cubic inch.

                        The sporty version of a Flathead engine had 742cm³ cubic capacity and 30hp.
                        In 1954 Harley-Davidson increased the engine to 38PS and a top speed of 161 km/h.
                        1250 units were produced and used as the basis for the racing engines of the KK series
                        and as a forerunner of the Sportster engines.

                        The Panhead engine, which had 60 hp at its deceleration in 1965,
                        was a model for the Electra Glide and already had an electric starter at that time.
                        The Panhead takes its name from the unmistakable cake pan look of the rocker boxes.
                        New aluminium cylinder heads, hydraulic valve lash adjustment and optimised lubrication
                        and cooling make the 1200 Panhead stronger, lighter and more durable.

                        The Knucklehead engine was produced from 36-47 and was the first Harley engine with overhead valves.
                        The Knucklehead got its name from its rocker boxes, which resemble the ankles of a human fist.
                        The up to 48 HP strong engine is considered today as father of all later, air-cooled Big Twin engines.

                        The V-Twin engine is fundamentally redesigned and optimized. From now on,
                        the cam shaft actuates the intake valve via a push rod, which is arranged in the cylinder head
                        above the exhaust valve. The engine is continuously improved and reaches at the end of its era 1215cm³
                        and 24 hp.

                        The two-cylinder engine with a 45° cylinder angle is designed by Harley-Davidson to achieve more power
                        than the current single-cylinders. The 810cm³ and 7 PS strong V-Twin engines are only produced in a small
                        series of 27 pieces.

                        The first Harley-Davidson was nothing more than a single-cylinder engine mounted on a bicycle frame,
                        which directly drove the rear wheel via a belt. The bike had neither a clutch nor a gearbox.
                        From the outset, the designers attached great importance to stability and quality, which has given Harley-Davidson
                        its reputation as a reliable everyday tool to this day.
